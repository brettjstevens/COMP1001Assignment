ASSIGNMENT README

This is the read me file for the program that we will call Fred. 
Fred is the ship part of a battle simulator. 
Fred can perform multiple tasks that are appropriate to that of the ship part of a battle simulator. 
These multiple task are:
	- Store details of submarines and fighter jets; either from an input file or an input from the user.
	- Determine which of the stored ships will be able to reach a specified destination first.
	- Display the details of all ships.
	- and, finally, output the ships to a file, thus saving them for later use.
	
Thank you kindly for reading this readme file; for without your eyes and ability to read words I would 
have written this nonsense for absolutely diddlysquat.
